</html>";s:4:"text";s:2813:"Furniture.com offers information on choosing between sectionals vs. couches and loveseat sofas for your living room seating. Chesterfield is the only one that I know of that is not used in at least some places in the US (but is very common in Canada). I’m sure many of you grew up like I did thinking that sofas, couches and davenports were all the same thing. Once you learn the characteristics that define each piece, you’ll never mistake one for another again. The two are actually very similar but differences do exist. If you want to have the matching-sofa-look with your existing sofa and loveseat, try this designer secret from The Decorologist: place the sofa and loveseat facing one another, add a large side table and table lamp to one end of the loveseat so that the other end is in line with one end of the larger sofa.  They may seat four or more people, compared to a couch, which often seats two to three people — making sofas better for homeowners who welcome plenty of company. I agree with the above chesterfield comment; yes, my nana used to say chesterfield, but I generally say couch.. even sofa is pretty rare nowadays. Learn about the difference between a sectional vs. sofa and how to decide which one is right for you. Here in America what most folks have in their living room is a sofa. "There's an ounce of pretense when people correct you and say, it's not a couch, it's a sofa," says Rumley. With a multiple-cushion couch, each cushion has its own boundaries and effectively sets personal space domains because of them. While it can easily boil down to preference, things like space and need can help determine which kind of seating will work best for your living room. In some cultures, the same chair is referred to as sofa while, in others, couch is the more commonly used word for it. You will see that people use the words couch and sofa to refer to the same comfortable chair meant for more than a single person that also has padding. So don’t make the mistake of thinking they’re synonyms. Sleeper sofas, also called pull-out sofas, look like standard couches, but they contain a hidden mattress that folds out, transforming the sofa into a temporary bed. Choosing between a sectional sofa and a standard sofa can sometimes be overwhelming. Can't speak for UK. "If you frequently have company, two- or three-cushion sofas are often more comfortable, so that guests feel as though they have a cushion or space of their own," says Allie Lowe, Wayfair senior category manager. The differences between a sofa and a couch are not exactly striking. It won't do to go around irritating all the 'sofa potatoes. The way we decorate says a lot about our personalities. The difference between a couch and a sofa is mainly in the size and the purpose of the two furniture types.
