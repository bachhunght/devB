Green-treated wood lasts a long time—and it’s ugly. Copper is still the most widely used element in wood preservatives and creates a green color on the wood. Pressure-treated decking boards can extend the longevity of wooden walkways, freshwater docks, accessibility ramps and other outdoor structures that are exposed to the elements. There are two types of treated lumber widely sold in Quebec: wood treated with alkaline copper quaternary (ACQ), and wood treated with copper azole (CA-B). Never burn treated wood. Typically, lumber is dried and treated before it reaches the market, so that it is ready to use. Creosote, a tar-like substance, is most commonly used for railroad ties, utility poles, and pilings. For wood meant to be buried—-as in Permanent Wood Foundation Systems (PWF’s)—-we want to see .60 ounces per board ft. Wood is filled with natural capillaries which are used by the tree to transport water and nutrients, and when it is freshly cut, it is full of water. In fact, the toxicity of treated wood has nothing to do with its colour. (Wolmanizing is a patented manufacturing process.) However, you should avoid exposure to the smoke or ash from burning treated wood. To start, pressure-treated wood is softwood lumber, typically southern yellow pine, that's been chemically treated to resist rot, decay and termites. There are three basic categories of green-treated, or Wolmanized, lumber. Green wood is wood that has been recently cut and therefore has not had an opportunity to season (dry) by evaporation of the internal moisture. Wood that has been appropriately treated can significantly reduce the number of trees that would otherwise need to be harvested. There is a long-standing controversy in the field of organic gardening: can pressure-treated wood be used as part of an organic vegetable garden? And they still do the job of protecting your structures against rot, fungus, mould, and insect infestations.  Use of a dust mask and eye protection is highly recommended. Any treated wood will eventually leach some of its chemicals into the surrounding soil (again, more so in some soils than others). I asked one of the HD employees the same question a few months ago. What can you do? The green color you see on treated wood is caused by chemical reactions that take place between the preservative components and the wood. So, if you build, say, a deck out of green-treated wood, it’ll be ugly for a long time. Freshly pressure treated timber has a greenish-yellow tint to it. If you suspect poisoning, seek medical attention immediately. Find quality treated lumber online or in store. As it dries, wood shrinks significantly, and it can also warp. AC2 ® CedarTone Premium Wood Products have a rich color that's similar to coastal western cedar with all the benefits of AC2 ® pressure treated wood. In fact, lumber at its basic form is considered green lumber. Some low level leaching (the chemical preservative leaking from the wood) can also be a problem with indoor projects. If you are shopping for treated lumber at a do-it-yourself retail centre, you may be confused by the choices and store staffers may not know much more than you do. Green lumber is lumber which has not been dried or treated, making it as close to the original tree as it is possible to get.
