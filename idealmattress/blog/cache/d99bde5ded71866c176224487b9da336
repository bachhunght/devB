Most residential pools that have a deep area for diving have a fairly steep sloping wall coming up to the shallow part of the pool. At a minimum, a pool with a one-meter springboard must be 11.5 feet deep at a point directly underneath the tip of the diving board. Type I pool diving board depths must be at least 7.5 feet and diving boards can't be any longer than 6 feet. Diving in residential pools is not a smart idea, and many areas have banned the use or sale of diving boards for private pools. Deep end water depths are rarely more than 1800mm.

Among the reasons: Backyard pools are smaller and not as deep as larger public pools, so they don't give the diver enough room in front and on the sides to land safely in the water without hitting the board, pool edge, or bottom. Diving from starting blocks and from the side of the pool also depends on many factors.
