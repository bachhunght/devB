You should not have to clean the main drain unless you have a massive amount of debris. Australia wide delivery. Here's my 'dumb' question: when the pump and filter are running, is water pulled from the main drain as well as the skimmer generally? I would guess that you are taking suction from the main drain as well as from the skimmer(s). I know this isn't normal. If you have other pressure side lines, like an automatic cleaner line or a spa return line, blow each of these out separately. You aren’t required to have any – but you can’t have just one. Just had the pump and filter plumbed in and I have realised that the main drain has not been connected to the pump. Purchased a home with a pool recently and I'm a bit confused as to how the plumbing is setup and if it's working correctly. Pump and filter are made by Sta-Rite, and the returns, skimmer, main drain (i think), etc, are all made by Jacuzzi. The drain - called main drain- is or should be connected with the skimmer plumbing and that goes to the pump. The pool is probably 40 years old. When the main drain begins to blow strongly, the double plug is slammed-fast into the hole, which seals both drain and skimmer at the same time. pool main drain valve. Details on using a Cyclone blower to blow out pool plumbing. This eliminates the suction on the blocked drain. Skimmer Setups. Combination skimmer diagram showing a connected main drain.

If you have other pressure side lines, like an automatic cleaner line or a spa return line, blow each of these out separately. Unless the pool has a dedicated main drain line and a positive seal valve it is best to use a submersible pump. Just because some pools can limp along and get by with the main drain deleted does not mean that deleting the main drain in your pool is a good idea. A pool’s so-called main drain is not actually a drain; that is, it is not used to drain the pool. Combination skimmer diagram showing a connected main drain. Let’s start with your Main Drains, and I said Drains because if you do install them in your pool you must have two drains installed, side by side. This is all underground, no mistake or screw up from my side. One goes to the pump, and the other is covered with a flap and runs down to the main drain. I haven't been able to locate valves that deal with the main drain nor the skimmer. I noticed that dirt around the main drain doesn't get sucked in and also confirmed that the main drain doesn't seem to be working. Rob Hampton. Equalizer Line Plumbing Back in the day, it was common (not so much anymore) to plumb the skimmer with a built-in low water protection, known as an equalizer line.
