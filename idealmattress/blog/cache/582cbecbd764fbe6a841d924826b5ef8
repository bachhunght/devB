The way bamboo grows is that every year during the warm months, bamboo produces new canes. How many new canes depends on the soil and water conditions, the age of the plant and the weather. Leaves are turning yellow.The two most common reasons for leaves turning yellow are: 1. You will have to cut the leaves, using a sharp, clean pair of scissors. A month or two ago I noticed the bamboo is getting some yellow leaves. A common problem for Lucky Bamboo plants are fluoride. Once each year you should remove older, unattractive culms and cut off any dead or unattractive branches. You might need a handsaw to cut dead stalks from larger plants. When you first bring a plant home, the roots may not look healthy – brown or yellow roots should be trimmed. Yes, you can cut it down but that cane won't grow back. Yellow leaves should be plucked off as soon as possible. I took those off, changed the water (refilled with rain water) and throw in a bottle of the green plant food thing. What happens is that the bamboo will cut off the nutrients in the leaves to use it in other places. Two out of 3 are fine, however the third stem began turning yellow very quickly. What can I do to save the bamboo? In the spring, the leaves of many bamboo plants will turn yellow and drop off. If you can, allow the dropped leaves to act as a mulch and return to the soil. Over-Watering: Generally, this yellowness will appear in a mosaic pattern, not solid yellow, and the leaves may have unsightly, crunchy brown tips but will not fall off easily. You may also notice new growth that is a faded, washed-out green. Two out of 3 are fine, however the third stem began turning yellow very quickly. Cut them just at the surface of the soil below the lowest joint, taking care not to damage the other parts of the plant. Make cuts just above a node, so as not to leave a stub that will die back and look unsightly. Environment Problem: Sometimes, the leaves of the plant will turn yellow if the proper environmental factors like light, heat, humidity are not maintained. Just trim so it looks attractive. The leaf tips will brown & the leaves will eventually turn yellow. Normal bamboo leaf yellowing Like many other plants, bamboo sheds its leaves and grows new ones. I have cut off the yellow part hoping this would stop the yellowing but it has continued. But now I'm seeing that the babmoo has grown more yellow leaves. Note that once any part of the bamboo is cut, it will not grow back. Soak a cotton ball or pad with rubbing alcohol and rub it over the scissor's blades to kill any germs. Step 2 Trim the leaves' yellowed ends off with the sterilized scissors. When lucky bamboo turns yellow from the bottom up, it is a strong indication of exposure to too much fertilizer. It is being used as great gift items and part of Feng Shui. Lucky Bamboo's popularity has significantly grown over the past few years. This will keep the remaining bamboo stems in the pot healthy. A few things can caused lucky bamboo to turn yellow — Too much light or too much fertilizer. I keep my bamboo in a large vase with water and … Although bamboo is an evergreen plant, it can still get a few yellow leaves and culms. What happens is that the bamboo will cut off the nutrients in the leaves to use it in other places.
