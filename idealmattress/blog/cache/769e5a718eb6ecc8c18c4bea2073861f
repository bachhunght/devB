Salt dissolving in water is a chemical change, the white residue is left when the water gets saturated by the salt and the salt starts to come out of solution to gain equilibrium. The last pool place i went to said that i put too much baking soda in the pool and that that could be the white substance on the bottom of the pool bc that is what it looks like. in 11 years this is the first time I have had the problem. The pool is still sort of cloudy and the white substance is still collecting at the bottom of the pool in the shallow end mostly and on the filter cartridges. Seems to be a problem shared by others on the net but nobody seems to have a solution. At this point it wasn’t hard to figure out what was going on, by keeping the pool running…this very light…almost like a talcum powder was forced to circulate or crawl if you will through the water keeping the pool cloudy, with the pool off for several hours it had a chance to settle to the bottom in pockets all over…NOW TO GET RID OF IT!!! Salt water pools produce softer-feeling water, which many find desirable. I won't speculate as to the source of the mysterious white powder*, but don't try to stir it up. Few things are more frustrating than to see the very stuff that is supposed to be filtering your pool water leaking into the pool. This year there had been a huge amount of pollen in the pool, I think we have mustard algae because when you touch or brush it the pool is cloudy. I personally would not play in this stuff!!! Because the salt cells in a salt water system only produce chlorine as needed, the pools require far less maintenance when compared to traditional chlorinated swimming pools. Your pool maybe be well balanced chemically, yet still show these effects. In six EASY steps. See images below. At some points inside the salt chlorine generator, chlorine concentrations can reach 50 ppm (the normal recommended level for pool water is a maximum of 4 ppm), pH can be either close to 14 or 0 (normal levels between 7.2 and 7.8) and temperatures can exceed 120 degrees, conditions destructive to the chemistry of traditional pool additives. They can be found in Salt Water Pools (quite often) Chlorine Pools (sometimes) and those filled with water containing a high mineral content such as in rural Australia and some cities. Scientists used to classify Saprolegnia spp. Most pool shop water analysis tests don’t test for these situations which are caused by impurities in the salt or chemicals in your pool. White Powder On Sides Of Pool. Throw a hose in the pool (not enough to reach the bottom, just a couple of inches underwater), raise the water level by 1-2" (will take a couple of hours for an 18x36), hook up the vac, unroll the backwash hose, set the multiport valve atop the filter to waste and turn the pump on. Still, the white particles settle again on the bottom of the pool plaster surface awaiting the the next time I brush to disperse and make the pool cloudy again. The powder is pure white, hard, granular and very fine and is not water soluble. To avoid this, all additions of pool chemicals or salt should be performed by first mixing them in a bucket of water, and then quickly dispersing the dilute solution into the pool with agitation. The easiest way to get rid of it is to allow it to circulate in the water by brushing it up. Last year we drained the pool then it was power washed and repainted. --of which white water mold is an example -- as a fungus, but research has shown the class of organisms to which they belong, Oomycota, differs from fungi in significant ways. This powder is really fine and settles to the bottom of a pool and re-appears again and again, unitl the problem is fixed. How do you fix your pool if it has a white powder that settles to the bottom and turns the clear water cloudy when someone swims in it? Also, salt will rarely leave a white stain in your pool. The common culprit involved in DE powder going back into your pool is torn grids but there are a number of other causes as well. It will almost always be brown or grey coloured. Finding scale in pools is nothing new; we've seen it from the beginning of the industry. The last pool place i went to said that i put too much baking soda in the pool and that that could be the white substance on the bottom of the pool bc that is what it looks like.
