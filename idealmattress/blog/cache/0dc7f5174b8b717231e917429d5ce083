Okay, I’ll say it: The Passion of Ayn Rand (Sunday, May 30; 8 to 10 p.m.; Showtime) is as delicious as it is dumbfounding, as mirthful as it is misbegotten. The screenplay is written by Howard Korder and Mary Gallagher. The bestselling biography of one of the 20th century's most remarkable and controversial writers. Barbara Branden was a personal friend of Ayn Rand from 1950 to 1968 and wrote the only authorized biographical essay about her, Who Is Ayn Rand? Author James Stevens Valliant is the editor of the private journals of Ayn Rand used extensively in his work, The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics. The Passion of Ayn Rand was the first full-length Ayn Rand biography ever published and this eBook edition is the most comprehensive biographical study of Rand available. flag 8 … The Passion of Ayn Rand is a 1999 television film directed by Christopher Menaul.It is based on the book of the same name by Barbara Branden (one of Rand's former associates and Nathaniel Branden's first wife).

The screenplay is written by Howard Korder and Mary Gallagher.  Alfred Don McKellar Based on her relentless pseudo-intellectual posturing, some might find the title “The Passion of Ayn Rand” oxymoronic. In 1951, Ayn Rand is a best-selling author and celebrated thinker when she meets two college students who admire her writing. There is much controversy that gets generated whenever her name is mentioned so I wanted to know more. Thus the name of this film: The PASSION of Ayn Rand----not the REASON or LOGIC of Ayn Rand. Initially I was expecting a hatchet job since many people despise her, but Barbara Branden provides a well balanced look at one of the most controversial and influential ...more. Due to the fact that the script was derived from Branden's book, the emphasis is on her and her bad marriage and less on Rand and her philosophy. The Passion of Ayn Rand (1999) Upon the death of Ayn Rand (Helen Mirren), Barbara Branden (Julie Delpy) recounts the story of her dealings with the enigmatic 20th-century philosopher and novelist.
