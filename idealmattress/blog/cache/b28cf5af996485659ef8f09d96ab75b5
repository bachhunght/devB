It doesn’t usually make sense to separate an open kitchen, living room, and dining room when there are other options available elsewhere in the home. Kitchen Plan – We looked at multiple layouts (click here for details), but decided opening up the wall between the two rooms would increase dining space and kitchen space. I was SOLD!!! Without any photos of what your home looks like, it's hard to say whether there are some architectural details that are worth maintaining. Opening up a nonstructural wall between the kitchen and dining room allows you to expand the kitchen by taking over the little-used dining room, so there's plenty of space for guests. I’m Laurel and I have a passion for renovating old houses. But, the thought of having an open floor plan…..well, I really didn’t even have to think twice about it! The cabinets above the countertop feature glass shelves and window panelike doors, allowing light from the large kitchen window to stream into the dining room. Knock through kitchen wall to dining room, close off kitchen door (so enter through dining room) and block up side door and window (we already have a window above the sink like yours but it is small so we will put a larger one in). By removing the wall between the kitchen and living room, we were able to create an open floor plan & completely modernized our dated ranch home. Now, it wasn’t our first choice (thank you Hurricane Harvey flood), but it definitely was the right choice!! Here, an opening between the formal dining room and kitchen makes the spaces seem bigger and provides shelves for storage and display. The builders also removed the wall between the hallway and living room. In this case, taking down walls allowed the homeowners to add a bigger island, a cozy banquette eating area, and a convenient home office. Glass doors on the ground level slide all the way into the walls, opening the family/dining room and living room to an expansive deck area. Welcome to our open concept kitchens design gallery. Hi! It is worth saying that there are a handful of drawbacks to the open concept kitchen layout, and knocking down walls to open your kitchen up to your dining room. The kitchen and the dining room are slightly shielded from the living room by the stone wall in between, this place speaks of dignity and grace. Here are a few things to consider before you pick up that sledgehammer. When you can't add on or bump out, open the kitchen to adjacent spaces and keep the layout simple Make it feel spacious. Here, bright pink and vivid yellow are used to create two distinct spaces – a lounge and dining area – in this open-plan room. We are looking to do something similar in our 1930s semi detached. And usually, in the open floor concept, the dining area gives the symbolic border between the food preparation zone and the rest of the daily living space.
