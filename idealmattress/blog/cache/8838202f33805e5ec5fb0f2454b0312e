So what did people eat till then? Answer. If tomatoes are from the Americas and Marco Polo discovered pasta in China, what did Italians eat before 1492? Since the introduction of fast foods, takeaways and frozen and tinned foods, Italians tend to eat less home-made food but fresh food is still quite common and most people buy bread, milk and other foods daily. Why do Italians eat tomatoes? I'm wondering, what was their cuisine like before the Tomato was brought back from the new world? The 16 Most Iconic Foods to Eat in Italy The most difficult thing about eating in Italy is that you can’t try everything. Traditional dishes are focused on what is available locally. The Italians made their sauces with cream, olive oil and cheeses. Italy is a European country rich in history with diverse cultures and languages. We still see this in northern Italy, and eat it in alfredo sauce with pasta popularly. I live in California, where we seem to eat a lot of sandwiches, salads, and Mexican food. What the Irish Ate Before Potatoes No food is more associated with Ireland than the spud—which didn't appear there before the late 1600s. Italian food has deep roots in antiquity, the Etruscans, Greeks, Romans, and even the Arabs had some influence on what we think of today as Italian food.First came the Etruscans, they ruled central Italy before the Romans arrived. So what was Italian food like before Italians had tomatoes? ... Italians eat a lot of pizza and croissants like french people. Polenta was eaten at lunch, at dinner and at breakfast, often soaked in milk (house cows were extremely common). What did the Italians eat before? Most likely the first variety to reach Europe was yellow in color, since in Spain and Italy they were known as pomi d'oro, meaning yellow apples. It was considered a poisonous plant for centuries, and indeed it ts related to nightshade. Before tomatoes, the Italian diet was largely similar to the diet throughout the rest of the Mediterranean. This article will explore the typical Italian diet and discover exactly what do Italians eat in a typical day. I heard once one Italian high nobleman arrived late in the night to an inn and asked an owner of the inn to give some food to eat. It took Italians an age to embrace the tomato, but the rest is juicy history, says Robert Appelbaum It has always bothered me that Italians call the tomato a "pomodoro", a golden apple, and have done so since the early 16th century. Marco Polo was Venetian, and in Venetian local food there is just In 1519, Cortez discovered tomatoes growing in Montezuma's gardens and brought seeds back to Europe where they were planted as ornamental curiosities, but not eaten. In addition, the savory, meaty taste of the tomato added some pizzazz to the average Italians diet, which formally was made up of a lot grain and beans.
