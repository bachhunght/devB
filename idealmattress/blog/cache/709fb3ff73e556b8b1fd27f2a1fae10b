Promotes extremely tight internodal spacing, leading to more flowering sites and a fuller canopy This bulb seems to have the brightness and intensity of a 3100K, but that beautiful spectrum of a well balanced veg bulb. 4200k for veg and 3100k for flower. The 4200K is stronger in VEG, but also flowers fabulously. Growers House is a direct supplier for Commercial Grow Operations as well as Grow-at-Home DIY Hobbyists Growers. According to Royal Queen Seeds, the most common model of LEC light or fixture is the 315W with a 4200K color bulb, this one is a tough competition for the LED grow lights which is also a great all … iPower 315W CMH CDM Grow Light Fixture with 4200K Full Spectrum Bulb for Plants. it has nearly the same color temp as HPS. The 3K 315W Single Ended CMH more closely matches sunlight Installed a brand new Phillips 4200k CMH lamp into this fixture and noticed immediately that it would flicker every couple minutes. Our Commercial Division provides a dedicated account representative that will help from design to equipment advice and even finance options from $10k to $1M+. If you’re growing a plant or two and you’re tired of always switching from MH to HPS bulbs when it’s time to flower, the Yield Lab 315w Ceramic Metal Halide (CMH) Grow Light Bulb is the light you’ve been looking for. Ideally, before anything was legal there was less choices and you either went with a 5-6000k bulb for Veg and a lower 2000k bulk for flower/bloom. I was wondering if switching the spectrum to 4200K for the last two weeks of flower would be a worthwhile experiment. I am using it for mid veg and flower..but lamp will burn out prior than advertised. Hi everyone, looking for some Ceramic Metal Halide advice from experienced growers using it: I’m thinking of running one 630w open fixture CMH in my 5x5 tent. The Philips ceramic metal halide (CMH) 315-watt 4200K bulb produces a growth-targeted crisp white light with high CRI, excellent PPF, and plant-beneficial ultraviolet (UV). These Philips lamps feature superior color quality and very crisp white light. 4200K is a measure of the color spectrum that the bulb will output the most. GrowPower 315W CMH Grow Light Ceramic Metal Fixture w/ 3100K Flower Bulb . Incredibly high 1.95 PPF (photosynthetic photon flux) per watt per second light source. Puts off minimal heat, and covers a 3.5 x 3.5 area with great penetration to lower flowers. I thought maybe it was a defective bulb and stupidly installed another brand new Phillips CMH bulb. I am using it for mid veg and flower..but lamp will burn out prior than advertised. Sunsystem lec 315, Phillips 3100k. Kills LED!! Posted by. Close. On the 2nd day of running the fixture the CMH bulb would not fire. I thought maybe it was a defective bulb and stupidly installed another brand new Phillips CMH bulb. With an improved vegetative horticultural spectrum and outstanding efficiency, the Philips MasterColor provides lush, compact growth for higher quality yields. 3,100° K Green Power or 4,200° K color temperature lamps available. Great White Bud 1,649 views Growers Choice brings us a 3K 315W Single Ended CMH (Ceramic Metal Halide) Light. Same thing....dead bulb in 2 days. 3. These PAR measurements were done at a height of two feet over the canopy which is the sweet spot for a 3 by 3 feet grow area. So, if you are growing with MH for veg and HPS for flower most growers swap bulbs after the stretch? But the included lamp is just fine. I've veg'd and flowered under both 3100K and 4200k. If your looking to replace HPS for flower, the 3100k is a good option. 540 μmol/s. The 3100k would not make a good HPS supplement. TERRIBLE light. Early finish? I have friends who veg and keep mother plants under HPS's which are 2100K and they even do fine, though I wouldn't use HPS for veg.
