The water activity does not say how much water in total sits in the food. The following points highlight the two main factors that lead to the spoilage of food. This is in turn affected by a range of factors such as water, pH, oxygen and temperature as well the physical structure of the food itself. Food spoilage is caused by microbes. Spoilage bacteria will make themselves known in a variety of ways. The food may develop an uncharacteristic odor, color and/or become sticky or slimy. Keep vacuum packaged perishable foods in the refrigerator or freezer. Find out what makes bacteria grow, and how to stop them from contaminating your food. Many types of microorganisms can cause food problems. The microbial quality of fish and especially shellfish is heavily influenced by the quality of the water from which they were harvested. This intake of moisture into the tissue of the food source is the perfect vector for micro organisms to infest it. To understand how to maintain the quality of food and prevent spoilage, we need to know what can cause it. Food spoilage refers to undesirable changes occurring in food due to the influence of air, heat, light, moisture, which foster the growth of microorganisms. Foods take different period of time to lose their natural form though spoilage. This is a very good example of how food spoilage occurs and food hygiene breakdowns happen. Microbial Food Spoilage can define the biological process which involves microorganisms can degrade and decompose the food material, at optimal environmental conditions (temperature, ph, oxygen, moisture etc.) Food spoilage increases microbial activity. Controlling heat, moisture and pH helps to inhibit spoilage by preventing microbial growth and slowing down the food's natural breakdown process. Spoilage organisms, such as bacteria, yeasts and mould grow on the food making it undesirable or just unsafe to eat all require moisture to feed on the food. A temperature of 40 °F should be maintained in the refrigerator. Dehydration is the process of removing moisture from foods, thereby slowing or stopping the growth of spoilage bacteria. Collect carrots, oranges, garden eggs, kontomire and pepper and leave them on a plate for ten days. Food’s Own Chemical Properties. In contrast to freezer storage, perishable foods will gradually spoil in the refrigerator. The water activity does not say how much water in total sits in the food. Spores are formed in large numbers and are easily dispersed through the air. Foods take different period of time to lose their natural form though spoilage. and brings some undesirable changes which make the food inedible to eat. The factors are: 1. Molds are multicellular fungi that reproduce by the formation of spores (single cells that can grow into a mature fungus). This form of tissue deterioration is a major cause of food spoilage. This intake of moisture into the tissue of the food source is the perfect vector for micro organisms to infest it. Controlling heat, moisture and pH helps to inhibit spoilage by preventing microbial growth and slowing down the food's natural breakdown process. You can use a conventional oven set to warm with the door open or an actual food dehydrator. Dehydration is the process of removing moisture from foods, thereby slowing or stopping the growth of spoilage bacteria. For years, safety (i.e., the exclusion or elimination of pathogens from food) has been studied separately from the prevention of spoilage. Microbial Food Spoilage can define the biological process which involves microorganisms can degrade and decompose the food material, at optimal environmental conditions (temperature, ph, oxygen, moisture etc.) Spoiled Food. Food preservation methods such as drying, freezing and adding salt or sugar work by lowering the available moisture in foods. Food spoilage and food poisoning are caused by bacteria. Molds may also grow and become visible. Spoilage can occur either in the field or in storage. Foods with the same water activity may have a very different water content. Cooking food deactivates enzymes and kills bacteria and fungi, but this process is only permanent for enzymes. Heat can further deteriorate food packaging, particularly if it comes from sunlight. The rate of spoilage depends on micro-organisms is dependent on the ability of these microbes to grow and multiply. Consequently, package deterioration could cause food contamination or spoilage. and brings some undesirable changes which make the food inedible to eat.
