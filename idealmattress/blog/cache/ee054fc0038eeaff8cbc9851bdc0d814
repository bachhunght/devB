If the lemon tree is still not producing fruits, it might be due to a poor rootstock. The answer is not straightforward as there are many factors that affect when a young fruit tree will start to produce fruit. Nearly every fruit tree sold today is grafted, including Meyer lemons. Determining Your Citrus Blooming Season And once they do you will have so many that you dont know what to do with it. Grafted citrus trees generally bloom and develop fruit at an earlier age than trees that grow from seeds. So be patient, fertilize and water well. That depends on the type of citrus, though a general rule of thumb is the smaller the fruit, the more often it blooms. Lemon trees are self-pollinating, so you don’t require an additional tree for the production of fruit. Even the crushed leaves of the tree produce a sweet citrus scent. You can always wait a year after good cultivation and see if fruit comes the second year. So be patient, fertilize and water well. Will lemon trees grown from seed produce fruit, and should hydrangeas be deadheaded? A Meyer lemon tree grown on its natural roots can reach between 10 and 15 feet tall, while true lemon trees can grow as tall as 20 feet.

There are four stages of growth in a citrus tree: flower bud induction, flowering, fruit set and ripening. Lemon trees like a lot of water but not too much rain, and produce fruit profusely and almost continuously.
