Is Cole Sprouse leaving Riverdale? “I mean, we’d never met, but we both grew up in the same town and then we both went to the same college,” she said. Find out here. Fans are freaking out after a twist in the Riverdale Season 3 implied Jughead is dead. In another story (issue #1 of "The Jughead Jones Comics Digest," June 1977) we find out he is named after his ancestor who is an American hero. He has since been promoted to series regular for the second season onward. After Archie and Reggie leave the office, the audience learns that the woman is actually Jughead's aunt who has just lied as a favor to Jughead to help keep his real first name (Forsythe) hidden. Forsythe Pendleton "FP" Jones II was initially a recurring character during Season 1 of The CW's Riverdale. The show has also faced backlash from the asexual community for its deliberate decision not to portray Jughead Jones as asexual, despite the character being identified this way in some of the comics, and despite being urged by Jughead actor Cole Sprouse to represent the character's asexuality. He is portrayed by Skeet Ulrich. According to an Archie Comics fanpage, Jug's real name is Forsythe Pendleton III. For a brief time, Jughead started to use his given name in honor of his ancestor. Forsythe Pendleton "Jughead" Jones III was a main character on The CW's Riverdale. But did Jughead Jones die in the season 3 ending? In another story (issue #1 of "The Jughead Jones Comics Digest," June 1977) we find out he is named after his ancestor who is an American hero. While Archie is often painted as the show's central character, Jughead's real name proves he's the true hero of the story. He is the son of former Serpent leader FP and Gladys Jones… Jughead was a senior at Stonewall Prep and the leader of the Southside Serpents with his girlfriend Betty Cooper. Actress Gina Gershon, who portrays Gladys, told E! Riverdale just wouldn't be Riverdale without Jughead Jones. After learning that this ancestor was … While Archie is often painted as the show's central character, Jughead's real name proves he's the true hero of the story. News that she and her onscreen son bonded quickly during filming.  Jughead reunites with his mom and sister on season 3 of ‘Riverdale’ This season, we finally get to meet Jughead’s mother, Gladys, and sister, Jellybean. Hid dad (who goes by the name FP Jones) just so happens to be Forsythe Pendleton II. In fact, if the comics are any guide, Jughead isn't even his real name on Riverdale, though that story may not be a major clue.
