A 10,000 gallon pool requires 6 to 8 ounces of granular chlorinator each day. 1 gallon of 6% bleach in 10,000 gallons raises the FC by 6.17 ppm (I won't get into why it's not exactly 6 or 5.7, but a rough approximation is just to use 6). The 1 gallon of bleach per 1,000 gallons, if the bleach were Clorox Regular or an off-brand Ultra at 6% concentration, would raise the FC to nearly 62 ppm so would be WAY too high. The final result will be an estimate of how much water your pool holds. normally 12% or 10% being sold in the pool store, and 5% or 6% in grocery store. And about how many ppm does say a 1/2 gallon raise it ... 1 gal of 5.25% bleach will raise 10000 gal 5.25 ppm FC 1 gal of 6% bleach or liquid pool chlorine will raise 10000 gal 6 ppm FC 1 gal of 10% liquid pool chlorine will raise 10000 gal 10 ppm FC The amount of chlorine required per gallon of water depends on the type of chlorine used to treat the pool. You are correct that it probably should have been 1 gallon of bleach per 10,000 gallons which would raise the FC by 6.2 ppm which is far more reasonable (assuming there is some CYA in the water). If you need to calculate how much bleach or Clorox you need to shock your pool, you will have to use 1/2 gallon of bleach per 10,000 gallons of water to raise the chlorine levels by 5 ppm. A typical bottle of Clorox bleach is 121 ounces of 8.3 percent sodium hypochlorite. If you are shocking the pool, you will have to use ½ gallon of bleach per 10,000 gallons of water to raise the chlorine levels to 5 ppm. You can't just stand there and guess how much water is in there. When shocking your 1000 gallons pool, you need to use 0.05 gallons of bleach to take the chlorine level to 5 PPM. If you simply want to raise the chlorine level, use 0.025 gallons of bleach to raise a 1000 gallons pool by 2.5 PPM. If you use liquid bleach, it will cost you $50 … Simply multiply the number of gallons in the pool, such as 4,978, … Step 4 Add the bleach to the pool during the late afternoon or early evening. However, it depends on several factors including how much the pool is used, sun exposure, and water quality. 1 gal bleach of 6% will give 10000 gal water 6ppm of chlorine, and 60ppm on 1000 gal water. To raise the level of chlorine in your above ground pools to 5 pmm, you need to use a maximum of gallon of bleach for every 10000 gallons of pool water. It takes way more than a couple of teaspoons of Cal-Hypo 65% or Dichlor to raise the FC that much in 10,000 gallons -- it takes almost a pound, as indicated above.  Using regular chlorine bleach (5% solution) at a rate of 6.5 ounces of bleach per 1000 gallons of water gives a chlorination level of 2ppm per 1000 gallons. This means you need 1/2 gallon of bleach for every 10,000 gallons of pool water. KNOW YOUR POOL SIZE: Just about every chemical calculation is based on 10,000 gallons of pool water. From experience, my pool, which is a 25,000-gallon in-ground pool located near the woods (lots of leaves and tree debris) with a rather high bather load (including lots of kids), will use about 1-3 ppm of chlorine per day. The same pool needs two 3-inch, 8-ounce jumbo tablets each week. A daily dosage of 11 ounces of liquid chlorine is recommended for every 10,000 gallons of water. bleach = sodium hypo = liquid chlorine in pool store, the difference is the concentration of chlorine. So knowing your pool size is critically important. On an ongoing basis, if you super-chlorinate the pool with 100-200 oz. Shocking a pool requires increasing the chlorine to 5 parts per million. Thus, if the chlorine level is already 1 ppm and you want it higher, add 0.00013 ounces per gallon to raise the chlorine by 1 ppm. It is actually quite deceiving sometimes how large your pool actually is. To raise it to 10 ppm, you need 5 gallons. If you need to mildly shock a 30,000-gallon pool by raising the free chlorine concentration to 5 ppm, you need 2.5 gallons of bleach. If you are just trying to raise the chlorine level by 2.5 ppm, then you will have to use as much as ¼ gallon of bleach per 10,000 gallons of water. The amount of bleach used to shock a pool depends on the size of the pool. However, to bleach 1000 of pool water, you will require (1000*1/2) /10000 which gives you 0.05 gallons of bleach. Just go by the granular chlorine. It takes a couple of teaspoons of granular chlorine to make 1 gallon of bleach. One pound of granular is $3, and will yield about 24 gallons of bleach (which costs about $2 a gallon).
