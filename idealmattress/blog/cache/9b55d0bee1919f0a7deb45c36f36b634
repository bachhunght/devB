Lessons that might be related to the classification of flowering and non flowering plants. Spore-bearing plants are simple, or primitive, plants, for example mosses and ferns. That is because ferns do no grow from seeds. Flowering plants reproduce with the help of male and female parts enclosed within the petals, while non-flowering plants do not have flowers at all. Non-flowering plants are generally hardier than flowering plants; they live in extreme environments, including deserts and the cold Arctic tundra. At the adult stage, the plant produces flowers which can develop into fruits and seeds after being pollinated and fertilized. ferns, horsetail, bamboo, anahaw, fungi, mosses, algae are examples of nonflowering plants. The scientific name for flowering plants is angiosperms. Non- flowering plants do not carry flowers they produce spores, fungi or cones the are used for propagation (reproduction). These species include ferns, mosses, algae and lichen. Nonvascular plants do not have such a structure, and they rely on wet environments for nutrient flow. There are some non-flowering plants that don't produce seeds. Here is some information about non-flowering plants. Examples of some of the most commonly known non-flowering plants are ferns, mosses and liverworts. They are evergreens and the cones are similar to the flowers of the flowering plants, but they don’t have the protective ovary surrounding the ovule. Plant classifications flowering and non flowering for kids Monocotyledons have one cotyledon (seed leaf), which is the food store of a seed. Flowering plants are divided into two groups. Gymnosperms are seed-bearing plants, such as conifers fir trees, pine trees,The ovules or seeds are not enclosed in an ovary. Seeds are like baby plants. Life-cycle of a Flowering Plant Flowering plants follow a specific life cycle.  The non-flowering plants are the ones with cones, like pine trees. This is also called asexual reproduction. Spores are tiny organisms that usually contain only a single cell. Gymnosperms are the group of non-flowering plants. Vascular plants are more recent, and they possess structures to move nutrients and water through the plant. By Caryn Anderson. These plants lack the vascular tissue system needed for transporting water and nutrients. Read on to know more. They usually have needle-like leaves. Instead, nonflowering plants produce spores that resemble seeds.

Followings are the non-flowering groups of plants. Gymnosperms are plants that the seeds are exposed. Instead the petals are made of stronger woody material. Flowering plants comprise the largest, most diverse group of plants on Earth, having populated most of the world--even the seas. Flowering plants produce seeds within a fruit. Non- flowering plants . There are more than 700 types of non-flowering plants, among them encephalartos, ferns, horsetail and conifers such as pines, hemlocks and firs. The flowering plants, also known as angiosperms, Angiospermae, or Magnoliophyta, are the most diverse group of land plants, with 64 orders, 416 families, approximately 13,000 known genera and 300,000 known species. Rose, hibiscus, sunflower, mango, mango, banana, and papaya are flowering plants. These plants release thousands of tiny spores, which are spread by … They also have leaves with parallel veins, and flower parts in multiples of three. Non-flowering plants, unlike seed-bearing plants, may live on land or in water.
