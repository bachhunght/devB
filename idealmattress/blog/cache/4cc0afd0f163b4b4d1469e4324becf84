Given that this country is so large, it is also home to several large cities. The world's largest urban area, Tokyo (37.4 million), has almost the same population as the entire country of Canada (37.6 million). Each entry is identified as a census metropolitan area (CMA) or a census agglomeration (CA) as defined by Statistics Canada.. The 2018 data on the 30 largest cities of the world, compiled by the United Nations Population Division, reflects the best possible estimates of the populations of these huge cities. Canada had 1,137 municipalities that held city, town or ville status as of 2011. Nova Scotia no longer has any incorporated cities, as they were amalgamated into regional municipalities in the 1990s. Municipalities with other statuses and unincorporated areas are excluded. As each city has its own unique personality, Canada offers something for every type of visitor to explore. The table below lists the census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada by population, using data from the Canada 2016 Census. This list includes only the population within a census subdivision's boundaries as defined at … Canada - 10 Largest Cities. The table below lists the 100 largest census subdivisions (municipalities or municipal equivalents) in Canada by population, using data from the Canada 2016 census for census subdivisions.. In anchorage, approximately 300,000 reside in the city. The best-known cities in Canada cover a range of destination types that reflect the diversity of the inhabitants and range from sophisticated urban locales to more laid-back municipalities. This list presents the 100 largest of these municipalities by land area in square kilometres at the time of the 2011 census. It has the largest population among all the four largest cities of Alaska. This statistic shows the real gross domestic product of Canadian metropolitan areas in 2016 with a forecast for 2021. This was the list of top 10 largest cities in the world 2019 based on the area that are well-developed and houses millions of residents and have been the centres of business, commerce, trade, entertainment, tourism etc. Name Population Latitude/Longitude; 1: Toronto , Ontario: 2,600,000: 43.7 / -79.416: 2: Montreal , Quebec: 1,600,000 Halifax – provincial capital and metropolitan area and formerly the largest city in Nova Scotia by population, now part of the Halifax Regional Municipality Canada lies in the northernmost part of North America and stretches from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean.
