For a detailed example of the pattern, have a look at the dedicated post: The Proxy Pattern in Java. With this pattern, we create an intermediary that acts as an interface to another resource, e.g., a file, a connection. Some of the advantages of using design patterns are: Java Design Patterns provide a traditional business approach to resolve a recurring problem. ; Structural: The design patterns in this category deals with the class structure such as Inheritance and Composition. Creational: The design patterns that deal with the creation of an object. On the basis of a static and dynamic instantiation process, a creational pattern is clubbed into a class creational pattern and object creational pattern respectively. Gof Patterns website discusses the Gang of Four Patterns in C++ and Java as well as behavioral, creational, and structural design patterns GOFPatterns (Behavioral, Creational, Structural) SiteMap These patterns focus on, how the classes inherit from each other and how they are composed from other classes. Scenario This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object. We look at examples in the Java API and code examples of each pattern. This course is part of a three-part series covering design patterns using Java. Christopher Alexander was the first person who invented all the above Design Patterns in 1977.
