As a plant, you have roots to help you absorb water. Xylem and phloem are the two types of vascular tissues, present in plants and together constitute vascular bundles.Their function is to efficiently transport the materials which can be food, water, nutrients, organic materials, etc. Together with xylem, they form the vascular tissue system. between the stems, roots, and leaves of plants.. Content: Xylem Vs Phloem. Xylem and Phloem Research Task 3/8/2014 Xylem and phloem are the conducting elements of vascular plants. between the stems, roots, and leaves of plants.. They work together as a unit to bring about effective transportation of food, nutrients, minerals and water. The water‐conducting function of xylem is one of the major distinguishing features of vascular plants. Xylem and Phloem are two different types of tissues which function by transporting minerals, water, nutrients, from the roots to other parts of the plant. The xylem and the phloem make up the vascular tissue of a plant and transports water, sugars, and other important substances around a plant.  Plant tissues have different functions depending upon their structure and location. The Structure and Function of Xylem and Phloem (c) describe, with the aid of diagrams and photographs, the structure and function of xylem vessels, sieve tube elements and companion cells; The inter xylary phloem can occur in two forms either as concentric rings or as radial strands. The phloem collects photo assimilates in green leaves,distributes them in the plant and supplies the heterotrophic plant organs. Phloem is a complex tissue system in plants. The word "xylem" is derived from the Greek word ξύλον (xylon), meaning "wood"; the best-known xylem tissue is wood, though it is found throughout a plant. Start studying Function of Xylem and Phloem. These systems use continuous tubes called xylem and phloem. Xylem is one of the two types of transport tissue in vascular plants, phloem being the other. The function of the phloem are:- 1. Phloem and xylem are complex tissues that perform transportation of food and water in a plant. It is the food conducting tissue of vascular plants. For more information on xylem and phloem, and difference between xylem and phloem, keep visiting BYJU’S website or download BYJU’S app for further reference. The phloem. Learn vocabulary, terms, and more with flashcards, games, and other study tools. The structural components of the phloem are as follows: SieveElements. Structure of Phloem. 2. Xylem is star-shaped, while phloem is round and actually surrounds the xylem. Unlike the xylem, phloem conducts in both directions. Phloem is the complex tissue, which acts as a transport system for soluble organic compounds within vascular plants.. Xylem is the specialised tissue of vascular plants that transports water and nutrients from the plant–soil interface to stems and leaves, and provides mechanical support and storage. Related Biology Terms. Content: Xylem Vs Phloem. (Plant Vascular System Development) The term phloem … Plant structure and function Aug. 4, 2005 Summary In the lab exercise regarding plant structure and function, we examined slides containing the different kinds of roots (monocot, dicot). The structural components of the phloem are as follows: SieveElements. Plant Tissues: Types, Structure, Functions, Xylem and Phloem. midrib. Structure of Phloem. Some-times growth rings can be seen. What is commonly referred to as ‘sap’ is indeed the substances that are being transported around a plant by its xylem and phloem. We labeled the parts and pointed out the different roles of each in the plant structure. They function in the transport of water, nutrients, sugars, proteins and RNA throughout the plant. The inter xylary phloem can occur in two forms either as concentric rings or as radial strands. Gymnosperm phloem These tissue combined with each other form the various organs and organ systems of the plant. Xylem and phloem are the two types of vascular tissues, present in plants and together constitute vascular bundles.Their function is to efficiently transport the materials which can be food, water, nutrients, organic materials, etc. The same initials in the cambium which divide to form xylem to their inner side also cut off phloem cells to their outer side.
