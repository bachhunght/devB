If the root ball looks busy get a sharp knife and cut off a few inches off the bottom of the root ball. One of the branch ends (with no leaves left) is actually soft - which I suppose is too much water as opposed to drying out. If you notice that your rubber tree plant is losing leaves, check carefully how you are caring for your plant and make a few adjustments.

The popularity of the rubber plant as an ornamental plant is due to its large, glossy, and leathery foliage.
