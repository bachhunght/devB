Strength: It is stronger than silk. Unlike synthetic fibres wool does not melt so it will not stick to your skin and cause burns. Major wool producers are Australia, Argentina, Canada, China, Chile, France, the Islamic Republic of Iran, New Zealand, Russia, South … June 24, 2015 We all know how wonderful wool is to work with and to wear, but did you know that wool also has natural UV protection or that it has anti-bacterial properties? Marino wool is the best wool fibre because its length is reasonable. They are a pair of long tubular and coiled glands lying one on each side of the alimentary canal of the Caterpillar. Silk is the result of secretion of silk glands. Moisture Wicking. to about 3,000 times for cotton and 2,000 times for silk. It is extracted from sheep. Silk filaments have an elongation at break of 20-25 percent under normal conditions. There are various types of wool. Tenacity - The silk filament is strong.This strength is due to its linear, beta-configuration polymers and very crystalline polymer system. It absorbs water well (M.R.11%), but it dries fairly quickly. Under the mechanical action of agitation, friction and pressure in the presence of heat and moisture, the scales on the edges of the wool ﬁbers interlock, preventing the ﬁber from returning to its original position. Wool is warm, natural and renewable. Properties and uses of silk depend on the variation of production. 3. It was found that the adsorption kinetics of lac dyes on the three fibers followed the pseudosecond-order kinetic model, and the adsorption rate of lac dyes was the fastest for silk and the slowest for wool. In addition, the outer skin of the wool ﬁber acts as a protective ﬁlm, giving wool cloth improved resistance to abrasion. Wool Fibre | Physical Properties of Wool | Chemical Properties of Wool Wool Fibre: Wool is a protein fibre. Wool fibers have a natural crimp, a built-in waviness. There are records that man knew how to make clothes from wool fibers as early as 1500 BC. It smells like burned hair or charred meat. There are some important part need to take care. Wool Fibre | Physical Properties of Wool | Chemical Properties of Wool Wool Fibre: Wool is a protein fibre. Here we will discuss step by step properties and uses of silk. Thermal properties - Silk is more sensitive to heat than wool. The greater crystallinity of silk's polymer system allows fewer water molecules to enter than do the amorphous polymer system of wool. One of the properties of wool is that it will not easily burn. Even today, wool is major in making garments, bedding, carpeting, and furnishings. At 100 percent relative humidity, the extension at break is 33%. June 24, 2015 We all know how wonderful wool is to work with and to wear, but did you know that wool also has natural UV protection or that it has anti-bacterial properties? To define properties of silk we need to define its physical and chemical properties. People who can sew use wool fabric for most of their creations because it is sold by the yard and is available in most craft stores. Properties of wool. Felting shrinkage is irreversible. Wool is a semicrystalline, proteinaceous polymer, part of the family of proteins called α-keratins, which also include materials such as hooves, horns, claws, and beaks (Rippon, 1992).The basic building blocks of proteins are amino acids, and extensive research has shown that wool is made up of 18 α-amino acids with typical percentages as shown in Table 3.1. Wool is a semicrystalline, proteinaceous polymer, part of the family of proteins called α-keratins, which also include materials such as hooves, horns, claws, and beaks (Rippon, 1992).The basic building blocks of proteins are amino acids, and extensive research has shown that wool is made up of 18 α-amino acids with typical percentages as shown in Table 3.1. alkaline solutions can open the disulphide cross-links of wool, white hot alkalis may even dissolve it. Fibroin, a sort of fibrous protein is secreted by each gland which at first is in the fluid condition. This study is concerned with the kinetics and isotherms of adsorption of lac dyes on wool, silk, and nylon fibers. Fibroin, a sort of fibrous protein is secreted by each gland which at first is in the fluid condition. the wool ﬁber contributes to wool’s unique property of felting. Silk is a … When subjected to flames it will smoulder instead. 2. These are some of the factors which make the fabric more popular. Marino wool is the best wool fibre because its length is reasonable. (It won't catch fire) It is strong and can be stretched; Read the kidcyber page about wool. It isn’t so much that wool retains moisture as it is that wool retains an ideal balance of moisture (regardless of how much or little water is exposed). Silk.  Because of its fire resistant properties wool is used to make uniforms for firemen.
