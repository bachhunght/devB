Run a garden hose on low volume at the base of the plants. Zinnias can also be started indoors. Choose the Best Plants for Cutting. Zinnias make terrific cut flowers, and cutting the flowers encourages new blooms.  Others are 3-foot tall plants with big flowers. Zinnias work fast. As cut flowers, zinnias are hard to beat, and in a cut-flower trial I visited at The National Cut Flower Centre near Spalding, Lincolnshire, the Benary’s range (so-called after the German plant breeder) were reigning supreme. Although zinnias like very hot weather, you should mulch the soil not just to cut down on the weeds but to keep the soil moist. Tightly shut buds might not open once cut so you should leave them on the plant. Zinnias add bold, vibrant color to gardens. Plants are best supported by individual stakes or, if being grown in a veg or cutting garden for picking, they look fine pushing up through nylon clematis or wire sheep netting, stretched horizontally one foot (30cm) or so off the ground and tied taut onto a series of canes. Remove spent flower heads to keep plants flowering until fall. Plant the right variety for your usage and that your space allows. I plant my giant zinnia about 10 to 12 inches apart. Zinnias are colorful additions to any flower garden, they’re great for cutting, they are easy to grow and start from seed, so they make a great choice for container gardening. Zinnias are colorful additions to any flower garden, they’re great for cutting, they are easy to grow and start from seed, so they make a great choice for container gardening. Plant the zinnias about one-fourth of an inch deep and at least six inches apart. 1-foot tall plants with a mounding habit. Cut the zinnias for fresh flower arrangements frequently. Growth Habit: Zinnias come in a wide variety of plant sizes. Zinnias in pots can look just as lovely, if not more so, than those planted in beds. Zinnias in pots can look just as lovely, if not more so, than those planted in beds. Some of the best and most widely adapted annual cut flowers with the longest vase life include alstroemeria, aster, celosia, cosmos, gypsophila, lavatera, rudbeckia, scabiosa, snapdragon, statice, sunflower, yarrow and zinnia (pictured). Here’s how it’s done: When plants are between 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30.5 cm) tall, take sharp pruners and snip the top 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) off the plant, just above a set of leaves. Spacing the seeds or thinning the zinnias to18 inches apart will encourage them to flourish. In summer, gardening requires plants with three key qualities: low maintenance (it's hot out there), heat and drought tolerance (ditto), and brilliant color—the brighter the better. It's best to cut flowers in your garden in the morning, before the dew has dried, or in the early evening. If you're interested in gardening as a hobby, zinnias are a fun addition to any garden. Some are low-growing. How to grow cuttings. The secret to getting the longest stems from your zinnias is pinching them when they are young. Zinnias are popular flowering annuals because they are easy to grow and maintain. Once you cut off the dead flowers of your zinnia plants to encourage growth you can use those flower heads to save seeds. The secret to getting the longest stems from your zinnias is pinching them when they are young. The part you cut off the plant is called a cutting. A packet of zinnia seeds will provide months of colorful blooms from spring till frost. Use floral pruning shears or simply snip off the head with your fingers.
