The Visitor pattern is the classic technique for recovering lost type information without resorting to dynamic casts. In strategy we have one data context and multiple algorithms while in visitor for every data context we have one algorithm associated. In Strategy pattern, we create objects which represent various strategies and a context object whose behavior varies as per its strategy object. I will also provide some closing remarks. The basic criteria of choosing whether to implement strategy or visitor depends on the relationship between context and algorithm. It is one way to follow the open/closed principle. Strategy and Creational Patterns In the classic implementation of the pattern the client should be aware of the strategy concrete classes. The November 2000 issue of JavaPro has an article by James Cooper (author of a Java companion to the GoF) on the Visitor design pattern. This type of design pattern comes under behavior pattern. Both visitor and strategy design patterns offer a way of separating an algorithm from an object, in this post we'll review the implementation of the patterns in a simple car wash application and try to figure out in which cases each pattern should be applied.. Bridge Pattern vs Strategy Pattern. A Visitor is like an extended Strategy that is polymorphic at two dimensions: the code executed doesn't only depend on the actual strategy used, but also on the parameter passed to it. This type of design pattern comes under behavior pattern. Strategy actually *is* a very basic pattern that can be seen as the foundation of many other patterns. The Car object is composed out of wheel, engine and body, each implements ICarElement. We discuss how to implement strategy pattern with an example from a famous computer game "Age of Empires". The .NET optimized code demonstrates the same real-world situation as above but uses modern, built-in .NET features, such as, generics, reflection, object initializers, automatic properties, etc. Notes. All other patterns (and much more) are available in our .NET Design Pattern Framework 4.5. Basic Object Model. In Strategy pattern, a class behavior or its algorithm can be changed at run time. In strategy we have one data context and multiple algorithms while in visitor for every data context we have one algorithm associated. In Strategy pattern, we create objects which represent various strategies and a context object whose behavior varies as per its strategy object. In this video, we learn the strategy pattern in object oriented design. In both patterns, one class (the Container) has a reference to an Interface or base class, which is obviously intended to be subclassed. So in short strategy is a special kind of visitor. State vs. Strategy Pattern. Visitor vs. Strategy pattern (subtle difference?) A design pattern is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. A practical result of this separation is the ability to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying the structures. Strategy and Creational Patterns In the classic implementation of the pattern the client should be aware of the strategy concrete classes. The operation's name and signature identifies the class that sends the Visit request to the visitor. So in short strategy is a special kind of visitor. Short Form: both patterns are uses of inheritance to add flexibility. Visitor The intent of the visitor pattern is to add operations to a class which has rich data structure. The basic criteria of choosing whether to implement strategy or visitor depends on the relationship between context and algorithm. In order to decouple the client class from strategy classes is possible to use a factory class inside the context object to create the strategy object to be used.
