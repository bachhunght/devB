If you are going to blow the water out of your plumbing system, connect a blowout plug to the city water inlet, and then connect your air compressor. We have ordered a replacement pump as we suspect that the pressure sensor may be shot. This is why the only fool proof way is the winterizing system using the on board pump and that still can possibly leave water in the line from the city water connection to where it joins the onboard system so blowing out the lines via the city water connection and the using antifreeze with the winterizing system via the pump is the only way to fully and completely winterize your water system. That will prohibit water pushed by the onboard pump to be forced out the city water inlet. One concern though is that when using an air compressor to winterize, you can’t remove the water inside the pump or other important areas in your RV’s water system. We did have one flat tire last summer. It is relatively easy to troubleshoot your Shurflo water pump if you are experiencing any difficulties. At the very least, open all of the faucets and the shower to drain away as much water … Patented. Drain the water heater, clean out the sediment; keep the drain plug out until you de-winterize the RV. Filling the Water Lines With RV Antifreeze. Turn on the compressor and let it run until all water is blown from the faucets and drain valves. Screw the Blow-Out Hose into your RV's city water inlet, then connect your air compressor quick-connect hose. Since it failed in the open position, it's not really necessary to remove it (though it's advisable if you can). We also fill our water lines with Rv antifreeze as a precaution , is the process you did of just blowing the lines out all or part of your winterization Screw the plug into the city water inlet, open all drains and faucets, attach and activate the air pump until all lines are clear. The RV hasnt been used since. water pump fuse keeps blowing out. I used my portable air pump, latched it onto the blow out plug, the pressure built up and was able to blow all the lines out… 1) drain all water lines and blow them out using the compressor 2) pour antifreeze into all drain traps and fresh water tank (do not pump antifreeze into the water lines) IF I do NOT plan to use the Alde, it is OK to add antifreeze to the water lines (in addition to all traps). When we turn on the water, particularely hot, there is lots of air in the lines. Running dry for those few seconds will not damage the modern RV water pump.  Buy Camco 36103 Blow-Out Plugs for RV Winterizing at Walmart.com. The RV hasnt been used since. we used the RV on memorial weekend and had no problems. ... From the fresh water tank, a water pump is used to push water through the RV. There may be one tiny problem: If your RV water pump is mounted like the one in my travel trailer, you may have to be a 60 lb skinny-as-a-rail contortionist to physically reach all the connections required to remove the RV water pump. This article is about troubleshooting your RV water pump system, and we’ll help you learn a little more about how this system works. We also fill our water lines with Rv antifreeze as a precaution , is the process you did of just blowing the lines out all or part of your winterization It seems that by turning on the shower hot water we can help blow out the air … pump pipes full of antifreeze (the RV type that’s safe for potable water systems) or use compressed air to blow the water out; Rather than fill our drinking water system with any chemical – even a non-toxic one – we prefer to blow the lines out.
