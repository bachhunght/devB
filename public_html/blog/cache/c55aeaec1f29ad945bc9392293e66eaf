Starck Philippe Starck was born 18 January 1949, son of Andre Starck, aeronautics engineer. Philippe Starck, (born January 18, 1949, Paris, France), French designer known for his wide range of designs, including everything from interior design to household objects to boats to watches. It is suspected that his interest for design was influenced by his father, an aeronautical engineer. Philippe Starck has repeatedly demonstrated that whatever its size or purpose, the honest object – in the introduction we evoked the honest approach of the man and designer Starck – does what it can do to the best of its means, most efficiently, most usefully and most respectfully, with a minimum of materials. Philippe Starck is a world-renowned French designer, known for his work in interior design, industrial design and architecture. He changes visual perceptions and plays with materials. Starck spent his childhood under his father’s drawing board, where he would spend hours sawing, cutting, gluing and sanding. With his vision of a better world. It's essential. I met Philippe Starck at his gleaming white studio in Paris. Known for his industrial design and his architectural creations, Philippe Starck is a French designer who takes versatility to a whole new level.His work can be seen in European and American Museums such as the Musee National d’Art Moderne, the MOMA, the Brooklyn Museum of the Design Museum in London. His creations harbour a responsibility for society and the environment. Product Design, is concerned with the design of objects, which have a practical purpose. Starck's eye was very natural. His work embodies the principles of elite design - that the designed world must have its own aesthetic and spiritual identity both separable from and serving its function. 1. After introducing us to his wife Jasmine, he asked what he could do for us. He studied at the Ecole Camondo in Paris. When these objects are manufactured and sold they become products. An extrovert. His respect for the environment and men also arrived in France for what he is granted the realization of the State Higher School of Fine Arts in Paris and the incinerator Paris area and the construction of the tower Bordeaux airport control. In an extraordinary thirty year career, Starck has made a profound and often revolutionary contribution to almost every facet of the ever expanding and ever reconfiguring world of design. PHILIPPE STARCK. He also created individual items of furniture to be manufactured by firms all over the world. With his vision of a better world. Philippe Starck: 'I couldn't care less about my life' ... Action needs style and elegance, and a little humour. French designer Philippe Starck was born in Paris on January 18, 1949. Startling. Courtesy Starck Network/JB Mondino. ... Cardin's style was a turn–off for Starck and made him more determined than ever to unleash simpler lines on the world. He has also worked as an architect. Philippe Starck is also a writer: Impression d’Ailleurs, avec Gilles Vanderpooten, Editions de l’Aube (2012) is his first adventure as writer. He liked lines in his furniture that were natural and smooth. A free spirit with an unconventional style. Philippe is a prolific designer of furniture and lighting.
