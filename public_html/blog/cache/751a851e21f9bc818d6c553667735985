State pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern.State design pattern is used when an Object changes its behavior based on its internal state. In Strategy pattern, a class behavior or its algorithm can be changed at run time. This pattern is close to the concept of finite-state machines.The state pattern can be interpreted as a strategy pattern, which is able to switch a strategy through invocations of methods defined in the pattern's interface. State vs. Strategy Pattern If we have to change behavior of an object based on its state, we can have a state variable in the Object and use if-else condition block to perform different actions based on the state. However, one big difference is the following: Strategy Pattern is used when the whole algorithm is changed to another algorithm and the client is responsible for that, whereas, in State Pattern, the class itself manages the strategy based on the state. But, depending on our needs and requirements, that might or might not be an issue. State pattern is always stateful but Strategy will not. State pattern drawback is the payoff when implementing transition between the states. This pattern is close to the concept of finite-state machines.The state pattern can be interpreted as a strategy pattern, which is able to switch a strategy through invocations of methods defined in the pattern's interface. The strategy design encapsulates a various set of algorithms for runtime execution. This type of design pattern comes under behavior pattern. Hello Hans, There are many discussions on the difference in State and Strategy Pattern because both share the same class diagram. State Game Programming Patterns Design Patterns Revisited. That makes the state hardcoded, which is a bad practice in general. State pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern.State design pattern is used when an Object changes its behavior based on its internal state. In State pattern, we create objects which represent various states and a context object whose behavior varies as its state object changes. In this pattern, an object is created which represent various states and a context object whose behavior varies as it's state object changes. This type of design pattern comes under behavior pattern. This pattern seems like a dynamic version of the Strategy pattern. However, one big difference is the following: Strategy Pattern is used when the whole algorithm is changed to another algorithm and the client is responsible for that, whereas, in State Pattern, the class itself manages the strategy based on the state. I hope you make a conclusion that it will be easier to change the program realized by state pattern than the one realized by strategy pattern in this case. Here , I tried to collect for better understanding . I hope you make a conclusion that it will be easier to change the program realized by state pattern than the one realized by strategy pattern in this case. This pattern seems like a dynamic version of the Strategy pattern. State pattern is useful when we want to maintain various states for a scenario in our program. In fact, Strategy pattern is nothing but a clever way of achieving functional programming in Java, even before Java 8. State Design Pattern is used to alter the behavior of an object when it’s internal state changes.
