If your filter pressure rises rapidly after backwashing (within hours or days), the filter media (sand, cartridge or grids) may be clogged with oils or minerals, requiring deep cleaning with a pool filter cleaner product made for your filter type, or replacement of the filter media. I like D.E. What Causes High Oil Pressure in a Car? You backwash the filter and look in the shed and all you have is an empty DE bag, or perhaps a bag with only a handful of DE in it, so you leave the filter running for a few days without DE until you can go to Pool Stop to chat with Paul and the guys and get some more DE. That is where you take it apart and clean "all" of the old DE out of the filter. Why is the pressure building so fast? This. Sand filters use special filter sand, cartridge filters pass water through a fibrous element, and DE filters pass water through a thin layer of diatomaceous earth that is coated onto a grid. Not adding DE right after backwashing; We have all been there, right? Please Help? When the pressure rises 8-10 PSI above the starting pressure, it is time to backwash or clean the filter. I like D.E. After backwashing a D.E. You backwash the filter and look in the shed and all you have is an empty DE bag, or perhaps a bag with only a handful of DE in it, so you leave the filter running for a few days without DE until you can go to Pool Stop to chat with Paul and the guys and get some more DE. Left unaddressed it will cause other problems as well, and those problems could have minor or major impact. When the pressure rises to a level specified by the manufacturer, it's usually time for routine backwashing of a sand or DE filter, or simple cleaning of cartridge filter elements. I have a Pentair FNS Plus filter system and a 55,000 gallon pool. Well, I just checked again, only a few hours after the backwash, and the pressure was up in the low thirties again, and there was much less flow. Now here’s a blog post with some practical use. If your filter pressure rises rapidly after backwashing (within hours or days), the filter media (sand, cartridge or grids) may be clogged with oils or minerals, requiring deep cleaning with a pool filter cleaner product made for your filter type, or replacement of the filter media. When I arrived the R pressure was 30PSI. filter powder is added to the filter, by pouring it … I have a Pentair FNS Plus 60 DE Filter. The ranges of operating pressures for filters vary widely, depending on type. Once all the DE is added, take a reading of the filter’s pressure gauge. My problem is after backwashing, The pressure reads 20 psi which is the normal pressure for my pool, but then after about 1-2 hours, the pressure is back to 30-32 psi. Using anything other than a DE scoop will give you either too much or too little DE. The pressure indicated by your pressure gauge is your new baseline pressure, both for purposes of backflush/reload, and for purposes of determining the necessity of the next filter cleaning. If you have a DE system and you ran the pump all the while it was getting nasty you need to clean the filter elements. DE filter gaining pressure too fast! I shut the sys down, bleed off the pressure, opened the filter housing and lifted out the old grid asbly. The filter we have is a Haywood DE (the pool is a Doughboy if that makes a difference) We've tried numerous things to get the pump/filter system to work properly; clean it, replace parts (some of which I didn't initially know were missing) treat it with DE. As it rises, so to must the oil heat up to find a level pressure to flow through the machine. Am I crazy to think it shouldn’t be clogging that fast? My water is pretty filthy but I keep backwashing and watch my money (de) flow out of my yard and then i put more money (de) into the skimmer for the filter only to work for a little while and then the pressure rises up to like 30psi and water barely flows into the skimmers anymore.  Try backwashing it again; if the filter's pressure rises quickly again, you may try a filter cleaning cycle. This is the clean starting pressure of the filter. When (probably weeks later) the pressure rises to a 10 PSI above the baseline, it's … This is because when you run a DE filter, the DE becomes tightly packed onto the grids.
