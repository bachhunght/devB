Simple descriptions and full source code examples in Java, C++, C#, PHP and Delphi. Filter pattern or Criteria pattern is a design pattern that enables developers to filter a set of objects using different criteria and chaining them in a decoupled way through logical operations. In these design patterns,the interaction between the objects should be in such a way that they can easily talk to each other and still should be loosely coupled. This article will give an overview of best practices in object-orientated programming and has pointers to some design-pattern tutorials.

Prototype pattern refers to creating duplicate object while keeping performance in mind. Object Pool Game Programming Patterns Optimization Patterns Intent. Structural design patterns are concerned with how classes and objects can be composed, to form larger structures..

Now whenever application needs object of that class instead of instantiating new object we will return the object …  Object pooling can offer a significant performance boost; it is most effective in situations where the cost of initializing a class instance is high, the rate of instantiation of a class is high, and the number of instantiations in use at any one time is low. Behavioral design patterns are concerned with the interaction and responsibility of objects.. Use the Object Pool pattern when Structural design patterns. Such Null object can also be used to provide default behaviour in case data is not available. ... objects are expensive to create and they are needed only for short periods of time it is advantageous to utilize the Object Pool pattern. But later the Gang of Four - Design patterns, elements of reusable object-oriented software book was written by a group of four persons named as Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides in 1995.
