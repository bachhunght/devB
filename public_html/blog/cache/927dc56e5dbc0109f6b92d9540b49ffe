A nine-course vegan tasting lunch or dinner at a four-star, Michelin-starred restaurant in Fitzrovia – exclusively discounted for Time Out. The service was excellent and the waiters were friendly.

We’ve been working our way around London’s vegetarian tasting menus over the last couple of years and Pied a Terre is a winner. Pied a Terre: A vegetarian tasting delight - See 1,177 traveler reviews, 560 candid photos, and great deals for London, UK, at Tripadvisor. Nine vegan courses, one Michelin star – don’t miss out on this awesome deal WHAT IS IT? Pumpkin is one of my favourite autumnal pleasures, so I had high standards when I saw the vegetarian tasting menu had a ‘pumpkin and squash dish’.Decorated with sprigs of rocket salad, the greenery added some contrast to the otherwise bright and vivid dish, while a lemon glaze coated the pumpkin and squash brilliantly. It’s been a hit with vegans, veggies and meat-eaters, and it’s fast become an integral part of Pied à Terre’s appeal. If you suffer from a food allergy or intolerance, please advise the team when booking.

Located in the heart of Fitzrovia, the Michelin-starred Pied à Terre was established in 1991, operating under the guidance of David Moore, and is part of Group Pied, which also includes Pied Consultancy and L’Autre Pied, its more relaxed, gastronomic sister restaurant in Marylebone. The service, food and ambiance are outstanding. If you suffer from a food allergy or intolerance, please advise the team when booking. Pied a Terre is a small authentic French restaurant in South Beach. Luke’s 12-course Vegetarian Gourmand evening tasting menu and Vegetarian Discovery lunch menu is a testament to his passion for creativity and unique flavour combinations. Marcus Eaves’ Pied a Terre was an early adopter on the vegetarian and vegan fine dining scene after it opened to diners in the early 90s, and its seven-course tasting menus are still delighting its non-carnivorous customers today. All the dishes were so so salty that we did not enjoy our meal at all and were just looking forward to dessert the whole time. Pied à terre is one of London’s longest standing Michelin fine dining restaurants offering vegetarian and vegan menus and a wonderful private dining room. We recommend allowing approximately 3 hours for this menu.
