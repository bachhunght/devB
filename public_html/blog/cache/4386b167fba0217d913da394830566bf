Currently, numerous artificial refrigeration systems exist within two main categories: systems using mechanical (electrical) energy and systems using thermal energy. The basic components of a modern vapour-compression refrigeration system are a compressor; a condenser; an expansion device, which can be a valve, a capillary tube, an engine, or a turbine; and an evaporator. The history of using cold temperatures for preserving food goes as far back as Palaeolithic times, when caves were used as places for storing food.
