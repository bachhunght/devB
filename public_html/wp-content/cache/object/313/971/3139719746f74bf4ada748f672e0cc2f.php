No Problem, we send out two different feel mattresses with every order.

The top comfort layer is available in <strong>Firm, Medium</strong> or <strong>Soft feels</strong>. Some people think that you need a firm mattress if you have a bad back. Thatâ€™s not necessarily the case as our unique Support layer will keep your back properly supported, regardless of the comfort layer used on top.

If you indicate you prefer a firmer feel but are not sure how firm you like it, don't stress as we send out both the Firm and Medium comfort layers to you.

If you prefer a softer feel, and indicate this, we send out both the Medium and Soft comfort layers. Try them both and then choose which one suits you.

Once you've unpacked your new mattress, you can try both the feels and decide which is Ideal for you! You can keep the one that doesn't suit or return it free of charge for us to re-cycle in a responsible way. You can try the different feels over a few hours or a few days before making up your mind. It's that easy. No pressure, no regrets if you make the wrong decision because you have as long as you like to select your ideal mattress.[/zozo_vc_section_title][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row center_row="yes" css=".vc_custom_1495720127319{padding-bottom: -30px !important;}"][vc_column][zozo_vc_section_title text_align="left" title="Value for Money" title_type="h4" title_weight=""]We've been involved in the Australian Mattress manufacturing and retail market for in <strong>excess of 42 years</strong>.

Our support layer has been designed to support the natural curvature of a human body. When sleeping on your side, it allows the hips and shoulders to sink into the mattress further whilst supporting the waist.

Australia is a <strong>really big</strong> country. Shipping bulky things just adds cost and wastes resources. Your Ideal mattress is made right here in Australia. Before it's shipped out we use a special high tech machine that slowly presses out the air and rolls it into a cylinder. It is then sealed in a thick plastic bag to protect it during transport. Itâ€™s then bagged and shipped to you with the comfort layers you've chosen.

&nbsp;

Once you get it home you simply cut open the bag with the special cutter provided and watch it expand into shape over the next few minutes. Open the two comfort layers and place them on top of the support layer. You can sleep on it that night.[/zozo_vc_section_title][/vc_column][/vc_row]";s:10:"post_title";s:24:"NEW to Ideal?
