Will the mattress be Ideal for me?" open="true" el_id="1481344647154-b4da1d7b-db22"]Our support core is made from HIGH DENSITY Aussie quality foam and will cater to both slight and larger body frames so donâ€™t be concerned. Your Ideal Mattress has a <strong>medium to firmer feel</strong> on one side and a <strong>medium to softer feel</strong> on the other, so you can choose the comfort level to suit your body. Larger people still have pelvic bones, hips and shoulders and still need comfort and support and your Ideal mattress will provide this.[/vc_toggle][vc_toggle title="Iâ€™m quite slim, will the Ideal mattress be right for me?" open="true" el_id="1481344669410-467a30b9-091b"]Itâ€™s very important that slim people have good support and pressure relief at their hips and shoulders to make sure they can be comfortable and get into their deep sleep cycles. The support core layer will provide back support and the medium to soft side will offer great pressure relief for hips and shoulders. Â However, you can obviously try both sides at your leisure and choose the side that best suits your body.[/vc_toggle][vc_toggle title="What are the sizes of your mattresses?" open="true" el_id="1481344691108-b00cd142-bdf8" css=".vc_custom_1501068680666{padding-bottom: 30px !important;}"]We use Australian standard mattress sizes: (Beware if you bought your bed frame overseas or from an International shop or the web, they may not necessarily be standard Australian sizes).

Our covers are sourced locally and sewn together in Melbourne. The foam layers are manufactured in Melbourne, then the air is gently squeezed out and rolled and packaged in our factory before being shipped to you.[/vc_toggle][vc_toggle title="Will it sag in the middle?" open="true"]Absolutely not! Your Ideal Mattress is made from the best quality materials available and is guaranteed to perform brilliantly. Â Your body has curves so your Ideal Mattress matches the natural curves of your body to provide support and comfort.

Iâ€™ve heard some foam mattresses get really hot.

Your Ideal Mattress is made to breathe and not retain heat or absorb moisture. The covers are also specially made to also not absorb moisture so they stay cool and dry, giving you a healthier sleep.[/vc_toggle][vc_toggle title="What sort of Base do I need?" open="true" css=".vc_custom_1495966826656{padding-bottom: 30px !important;}"]Your Ideal Mattress will provide great support and comfort on any flat and firm base. A bed frame base (with slats no more than 70cm apart), a platform base thatâ€™s not sprung (old sprung bases will sag in the middle and not give correct support and comfort) or flat boards (they should have some holes for ventilation) can provide a great foundation for your Ideal Mattress. If you need a base, why not purchase one of ours? They can be shipped out with your mattress, free of charge. They are also made in Australia, and have been designed to suit your Ideal Mattress.

[/vc_toggle][zozo_vc_section_title text_align="left" title="Delivery Questions" title_type="h4" title_weight=""][/zozo_vc_section_title][vc_toggle title="How long until I get my new mattress?" open="true"]Your Ideal mattress will be despatched from the factory within 1 business day of confirmation of payment. Your order, name and address details are also given to our delivery concierge service immediately. They contact you to discuss delivery arrangements and begin the delivery process. If youâ€™re not available on certain days, they note that and can organise around it. Most of our customers get their mattress in 3-5 business days from when they ordered it.[/vc_toggle][vc_toggle title="What if I canâ€™t be home to accept delivery?" open="true"]Why not get it delivered to your work? Because we donâ€™t ship air, itâ€™s really not that big and is less than half the weight of a conventional inner spring mattress, so most people can lay it across the back seat of their car and take it home. All mattresses are shipped in a soft, heavy duty canvas bag. Queen mattresses are about 1.6m long and the bag is about 42cm in diameter, so it will fit easily into most cars. It's brilliant for transporting to remote holiday homes.

If that doesnâ€™t work for you, how about having it delivered to a relative, friend or neighbours home?[/vc_toggle][vc_toggle title=" Do you provide on-line tracking?" open="true"]Sure we do. Our concierge will email you the tracking number and youâ€™ll be able to see it at every step of the way.[/vc_toggle][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][zozo_vc_section_title title="What if I want to return it?" title_weight=""]
