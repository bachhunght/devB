Some people think that you need a firm mattress if you have a bad back. That’s not necessarily the case as our unique Support layer will keep your back properly supported, regardless which comfort layer you choose to sleep on.

Try both sides of the mattress and then choose which one suits you the best.[/zozo_vc_section_title][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row bg_style="grey-wrapper" center_row="yes" css=".vc_custom_1495721629931{padding-bottom: -30px !important;}"][vc_column][zozo_vc_section_title text_align="left" title="No Sagging" title_type="h4" title_weight=""]Your ideal mattress is made from special high tech materials, designed to last.

Our support layer has been designed to support the natural curvature of a human body. When sleeping on your side, it allows the hips and shoulders to sink into the mattress further whilst supporting the waist. When sleeping on your back, your Ideal mattress will support your lower back and allow correct spinal alignment.[/zozo_vc_section_title][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row bg_style="grey-wrapper" center_row="yes" css=".vc_custom_1501492518404{padding-bottom: -30px !important;}"][vc_column][zozo_vc_section_title text_align="left" title="How will it be delivered?" title_type="h4" title_weight=""]There's no point shipping air, so we don't. Australia is a <strong>really big</strong> country. Shipping bulky things just adds cost and wastes resources. Your Ideal mattress is made right here in Australia. Before it's shipped out we use a special high tech machine that slowly presses out the air and rolls it into a cylinder. It is  sealed in a thick plastic bag to protect it during transport. It’s then bagged and shipped to you and is ready to use as soon as you get it home.

Once you get it home you simply cut open the bag with the special cutter provided and watch it expand into shape over the next few minutes.  You can sleep on it that night.[/zozo_vc_section_title][/vc_column][/vc_row]";s:10:"post_title";s:14:"Why buy ideal?";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:13:"why-buy-ideal";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2017-09-17 09:05:14";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2017-09-17 09:05:14";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:0;s:4:"guid";s:39:"http://idealmattress.com.au/?page_id=28";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"page";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
