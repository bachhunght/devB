That's right, apart from very remote areas, we will deliver for FREE and if after the 30 night trial you're not completely satisfied, we will also pick it up for free!

Remote areas are defined as more than 200km away from Perth, all of the NT and more than 200km north &amp; west of Adelaide. Please <a href="http://idealmattress.com.au/contact-us/">email us</a> for a freight quote if you're in a remote location.

We understand that you’re busy and can’t always be at home during week days. Our delivery partners offer a concierge service, where they estimate the day they will arrive but you can also choose the next day, or if you can’t be at that location for the whole day then we recommend you do one of the following:[/vc_column_text][zozo_vc_list_item classes="delivery-list" icon_align="left" icon_fontawesome="fa fa-truck" icon_spacing="50px"]Have it delivered to your work or partners work. All but one mattress, the King are small enough to fit on the back seat of most cars and can easily be taken home. The King mattress is about 187cm long and about 42 x 42cm high &amp; wide. It will fit into most cars, wagons and SUV’s if at least part of the rear seat is folded flat. They are very light compared to typical mattresses so one person can usually carry it.[/zozo_vc_list_item][zozo_vc_list_item classes="delivery-list" icon_align="left" icon_fontawesome="fa fa-truck" icon_spacing="50px"]Have a friend or neighbour come round to accept delivery if you need to pop out for a short time;[/zozo_vc_list_item][zozo_vc_list_item classes="delivery-list" icon_align="left" icon_fontawesome="fa fa-truck" icon_spacing="50px"]Have it delivered to a friend or relatives home if you know they will be home all day, or[/zozo_vc_list_item][zozo_vc_list_item classes="delivery-list" icon_align="left" icon_fontawesome="fa fa-truck" icon_spacing="50px"]Indicate that the goods may be left at your home unattended if you think it’s safe to do this at your address. This option will not be suitable for everyone and you take the risk if someone takes your mattress.[/zozo_vc_list_item][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_column_text]Please be aware that if you ask for the goods to be delivered and have not authorised them to be left unattended, and are not home, our freight partners must take them back to the depot and then arrange a re-delivery, and an additional charge will apply.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][/vc_column][/vc_row]";s:10:"post_title";s:16:"Delivery Options";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:16:"delivery-options";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2017-10-02 07:01:43";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2017-10-02 07:01:43";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:0;s:4:"guid";s:39:"http://idealmattress.com.au/?page_id=12";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"page";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
