		    			<a href="#">What is the Value of a CCTV Systems for my Premises?</a>
		    			<div class="faqs-content">
						  <p>Your new CCTV system will deter criminals from entering your premises to avoid being recorded trespassing or committing criminal acts. If they do access the property, you’ll have evidence of their activity and this can be used by police to prosecute them. Apart from improving security, CCTV systems will help you monitor your pets’ behaviour when you’re not at home or give you a view of children or the elderly when you can’t be in the room with them 24/7.</p>

		    		<li>
		    			<a href="#">Is a CCTV System a Good Business Investment?</a>
		    			<div class="faqs-content">
						  <p>In addition to being a criminal deterrent, a CCTV installation can help you improve product control, provide Work Cover evidence and save money on security patrol costs.</p>

		    			<a href="#">Digital CCTV vs Analog CCTV—What are the Differences?</a>
		    			<div class="faqs-content">
						  <p>Digital IP CCTV systems contain top of the range components that provide exceptional quality images. Other benefits include PoE (Power Over Ethernet) compatibility, the need for only one CAT6 data cable for NVR connection and you get remote access via smartphone/tablet.</p>
						  <p>In contrast, an analog system gives lower quality images without any remote access. Setup is more complicated as each camera requires a separate power source.</p>
						</div>
		    		</li>
		    		<li>
		    			<a href="#">Will I Get a Wireless or Wired CCTV Setup?</a>
		    			<div class="faqs-content">
						  <p>We believe in wired CCTV systems because we want to give our clients maximum reliability. This is less likely with wireless systems as cameras can easily disconnect from the Wi-Fi network. A wireless system is also more difficult to maintain as you either need to replace batteries continuously or ensure there’s a working power outlet for each camera.</p>
						</div>
		    		</li>
		    		<li>
		    			<a href="#">Will my CCTV System be Safe from Weather Conditions and Vandals?</a>
		    			<div class="faqs-content">
						  <p>We’re proud of high quality cameras with the following specs that make them appropriate for outdoor installation:</p>
						  <ol>
						    <li>IP67 weather proof ratings</li>
							<li>IK10 vandal proof ratings</li>
							<li>-30°C – +60°C environmental operating conditions</li>
						  </ol>

		    			<a href="#">How Much Data can my CCTV System Store?</a>
		    			<div class="faqs-content">
						  <p>You don’t want valuable footage to be overwritten so we’ll help you pick the right package for your needs. You can have storage of 1TB up to 8TB or much more simply by adding more hard drives. An ideal guideline is to store 1 month’s footage at a time. When the hard drives are full the system will overwrite 10 minutes of footage at a time.</p>

						  </ol>
						</div>

		    		</li>
		    		<li>
